# BS3-datepicker-alternative
Trying to come up with pure JS datepicker without any dependecies yet having similar functionality as BS3 Datepicker

I am not a guy who would use a lot of 3rd Party Libraries until and unless absolutely needed. For Example, to use Bootstrap Datepicker, I will have to include these dependencies :

1) JQuery<br>
2) Bootstrap CSS<br>
3) Bootstrap JS<br>
4) Moment JS<br>
5) Datepicker JS<br>
6) Datepicker CSS<br>

While actually I need only one JS and one CSS file.

The library is supposed to help people like me, who use a framework like (Angular / Backbone / Ember) and dont want to use JQuery for DOM Manipulation.

I believe in writing foundation JS and CSS. Hence the effort :)

Note : This is not production ready.
